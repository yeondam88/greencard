You will have to prove that you are unlikely to become dependent on the U.S. government for your living expenses. There is no specific amount of money you must prove you have. The consular officer will consider the totality of your circumstances during your visa interview.

More than 50,000 people are selected in the lottery because some people selected don’t qualify for the visa or don’t pursue the visa, and USCIS wants to make sure all 50,000 visas are issued. Only the first qualified 50,000 applicants will be issued visas. After those visas are all issued, the program will end. If you wish to receive your visa, you must act promptly when selected. If you miss or reschedule your appointment or come without the required documentation, you risk a visa being unavailable.
